.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm xplot
is a fast visualization tool for examining multiple data sets in
parallel plots.  It supports easy zoom-in and zoom-out capabilities,
and synchronized views into multiple data sets (with the 
.Ar -x , 
.Ar -y , 
and 
.Ar -tile
options).

.Sh OPTIONS
.Ar -1
allows one to look at multiple data sets, one at a time.
This changes the behavior of click-right and shift-click-right from
exiting and printing to cycling forward and backward through the
various plots.

.Ar -d
.Ar display, 
.Ar -display
.Ar display,
.Ar -d2
.Ar display, 
all select which display(s) on which to draw the graphs.

.Ar -mono
causes the graph(s) to be drawn in black and white, with no use of
color. 

.Ar -tile
allows one to look at multiple data sets in parallel.  The plots will
each consume 1/nth of the vertical space that would have been used
with one plot.  This works well if the window manager refrains from
wasting pixels with decorative tabs and respects the hints that
.Nm xplot
provides.

.Ar -v
prints the version number.

.Ar -x
causes several graphs to be synchronized on the X-axis (zooming in one
window zooms all the others, with the same portion of the X-axis on
display).  The Y-axis of the other graphs will be autoscaled to fit
the data.

.Ar -y
causes several graphs to be synchronized on the Y-axis (zooming in one
window zooms all the others, with the same portion of the Y-axis on
display).

.Sh USE OF MOUSE BUTTONS
When running
.Nm xplot, 
the mouse may be used to zoom in and out on data.

Dragging with the left mouse button depressed while inside the axes of
the graph draws a rubber-band box around the area to be replotted in
the existing window.

Dragging with the left mouse button depressed while outside the axes
(below the X-axis or to the left of the Y-axis) selects the range of
the axis to plot.  In effect, this is like the previous mechanism, but
only zooming on one axis.

Dragging with the middle mouse button inside the axes pans the graph;
the start-drag position ends up being at the end-drag position.
Dragging on the axes pans only in one dimension.

Clicking the left mouse button zooms out to the previous view.
One can zoom in multiple times, then back up through each view.
Panning locations are not saved.

Clicking the right mouse button exits the program.

Shift-clicking on the mouse buttons produces Postscript files with the
same axis extents as the current view.  Shift-left produces a
full-page view.  Shift-middle produces a squarish plot, and
shift-right a plot such that three of them fit on a page of LaTeX.

.Sh PLOT LANGUAGE
There are several example files 
.Pa demo.0,
.Pa demo.1, 
.Pa demo.2,
etc., 
stored with the 
.Nm xplot
sources.  
.Pa demo.0
lists all the commands.
.Dl xplot demo.0
demonstrates 
.Nm xplot's 
capabilities.

.Sh USE WITH TCPDUMP
The command
.Dl tcpdump -tt -S ... > tcpdump.out
saves a 
.Nm tcpdump 
formatted output trace to
.Ar tcpdump.out.  The 
.Ar -tt
and 
.Ar -S 
flags tell 
.Nm tcpdump 
to print an unformatted timestamp and to use absolute TCP sequence
numbers. 

This trace can then be examined by being processed with
.Nm tcpdump2xplot.

.Dl tcpdump -plot tcpdump.out

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr tcpdump2xplot 1 ,
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm xplot
command was written by Tim Shepard as a tool to use in his analysis of
TCP performance while at MIT.
Some features were added by Andrew Heybey and Greg Troxel.

.Sh BUGS
Some people may not like that the right mouse button exits without
confirmation, although others consider it a feature that enables
rapidly viewing hundreds of similar plots.

Should use standard X geometry specifications.
